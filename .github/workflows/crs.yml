permissions:
  # Not all workflows demonstrated here require the same permissions. Some do
  # not need the write permissions. However, GHA do not support specifying
  # permissions settings at the granularity of the step, so you need to set the
  # permissions to the union of all permissions required by all steps. Make sure
  # in your workflows to set the permissions to the minimum strictly required by
  # the workflows you use. Here we add more permissions in each PR depending on
  # the requirements.
